Working through Think Like a Programmer

## Logic Lessons

**Fox Goose & Corn**

Description:

Lessons Learned:
- Restate the problem in a more formal manner to gain more insight into the problem.
- Discuss the problem with other programmers
- If you have no one to discuss with, have the discussion and play both parts
- Thinking about the problem is more productive than thinking about the solution
- The correct approach to the solution is often the solution

Lessons Learned:
- We are often faced with problems where there isn’t a “clear path” to code the solution
- Don’t let this be an excuse to forgo planning and systematic approaches
- It’s always better to develop a strategy than to attack it through trial & error
- Problems can sometimes be divisible in ways that aren’t obvious
- Look for ways to divide a problem into smaller parts
- Working with a specific goal (or sub-goal) in mind is better than random effort

**Sudoku**

Don’t waste your time: Use a newspaper

Lessons Learned:
- Look for the “most-constrained” part of the problem
- Constraints simplify our thinking about the solution because they eliminate choices
- If one part of the problem is heavily constrained, that’s a great place to start
- Also, if something is obvious, start there.
- If you can solve part of the problem, go ahead. It may be inspiration to solve the rest

**Quarrasi Lock**

Dumb thing disguised as Fox/Goose/Corn

Lessons Learned:
- It’s important to recognize analogies in the problem
- If you’ve solved A, and A looks similar to B, use what you learned.
